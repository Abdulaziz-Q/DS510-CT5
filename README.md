### CT5: Name Lengths

In this activity, we will examine data to research whether individuals with long last names still have long first names? Create and analysis a linear regression model focused on the relationship in the data set between the duration of the first and last names and offer insights into the phenomena within the constraints of the model. We count the letters of alphabets used to name 100 persons from this dataset.
